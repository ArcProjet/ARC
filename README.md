Welcome,

This is the github of ARC Challenge project !
We're first-year students at engineering school named INSA Rennes and our goal is to solve as many ARC grids as possible using artificial intelligence.

ARC Challenge (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) is a challenge where artificial intelligence tries to solve as many colorful grids as possible. Many of this grid can be solved by man (about 90%) but machines cannot do it. The first objective of the challenge is to develop artificial intelligence and the current record is 30%.

After our teacher’s advice, we use a brute force algorithm and a genetic algorithm on the grids we have. The current program is a prototype that we’re trying to update to get the best possible result.

Thank you for reading and enjoy your visit.
